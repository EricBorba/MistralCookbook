        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "In modern software development, a significant challenge is efficiently converting customer calls and meetings into actionable development tickets. This process typically involves:\n",
        "- Manual note-taking during calls\n",
        "- Converting notes into Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)\n",
        "- Breaking down PRDs into actionable tickets\n",
        "- Creating and managing tickets in project management tools (ex:- Linear)\n",
        "\n",
        "This manual process is:\n",
        "- Time-consuming\n",
        "- Prone to information loss\n",
        "- Subject to inconsistencies\n",
        "- Difficult to scale\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Solution\n",
        "We've created an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs to streamline this process:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stage 1: PRD Generation\n",
        "- Takes raw call transcripts as input\n",
        "- Uses Mistral AI LLM to generate structured PRD\n",
        "- Implements iterative refinement for accuracy\n",
        "- Ensures alignment with original discussion (from transcript)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stage 2: Feature & Technical requirements Extraction\n",
        "- Analyzes PRD to identify distinct features\n",
        "- Extracts technical requirements\n",
        "- Captures constraints and success metrics\n",
        "- Maintains traceability to original content(call/ transcript)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Mistral LLM Integration\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution uses several Mistral AI LLM capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Chat Completion API**\n",
        "   - Used for PRD generation\n",
        "   - Handles iterative refinement\n",
        "   - Processes feedback and improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Structured Output**\n",
        "   - Formats PRD content\n",
        "   - Extracts feature lists\n",
        "   - Generates ticket descriptions\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Context Management**\n",
        "   - Maintains consistency across iterations\n",
        "   - Preserves original transcript context\n",
        "   - Ensures accurate information flow\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook walks through the implementation of this pipeline, demonstrating how to automate the journey from call transcripts to PRD creation to actionable development tickets on Linear."
